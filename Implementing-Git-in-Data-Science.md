# Implementing Git in Data Science

Some interesting references:

The following 2 articles are really useful. The author is also exploring how to apply software engineering methods to Data Science projects:

- [Structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project - part I](https://towardsdatascience.com/structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-2fa30d661c1e)
- [Structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-part-2](https://towardsdatascience.com/structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-part-2-b5b420625102)

From the same author of the above two articles, we have the following interesting article too:

- [Building-package-for-machine-learning-project-in-python](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-package-for-machine-learning-project-in-python-3fc16f541693)

## Approaches to deal with data and version control - Data Versioning

Using Git for manage your code is a must. But also, you should able to track your data. There are different new approaches to this specific issue in Data Science projects.

- [Structuring-ml-projects-so-they-can-grow](https://towardsdatascience.com/structuring-ml-projects-so-they-can-grow-b63e89c8be8f)

The above article uses a Python package named [**lazydata**](http://github.com/rstojnic/lazydata) that is built specifically to manage data for growing ML projects.

In the following articles, the author mentions another interesting tool to manage files with git: [**git-annex**](http://git-annex.branchable.com/). 

- [How-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task-cad74dce44c4)

The above articles is mainly devoted to the most rich tool so far named [**Data Version Control or DVC**](https://dataversioncontrol.com/). This author also has the following less interesting article:

- [How-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task](https://becominghuman.ai/how-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task-ii-d37da60ef570)

Here it is another interesting article:

- [How-to-use-data-version-control-dvc-in-a-machine-learning-project](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-data-version-control-dvc-in-a-machine-learning-project-a78245c0185)

Here there are some interesting resources about DVC tool:

- [DVC tutorial](https://dvc.org/doc/tutorial)
- [DVC webpage](https://dvc.org/)

- [Version Control For Your Machine Learning Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RhjIFM9Z9s)
- A transcription of the above postcast is here (also on the web page of the postcast) [Data-version-control-with-dvc-what-do-the-authors-have-to-say](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-version-control-with-dvc-what-do-the-authors-have-to-say-3c3b10f27ee)

The above podcast is really interesting. MLFlow is the winner for model deployment. All tech companies have their on ML platform that solves all this problems already. DVC is inspired by these ML platforms. Spark Airflow is mentioned too. They talk about many interesting things. Including model deployment using DVC.
