# Implementing Git in Data Science

Some interesting references:

The following 2 articles are really useful. The author is also exploring how to apply software engineering methods to Data Science projects:

- [Structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project - part I](https://towardsdatascience.com/structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-2fa30d661c1e)

From the same author of the above two articles, we have the following interesting article too:
