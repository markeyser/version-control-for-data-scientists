# Implementing Git in Data Science

Some interesting references:

The following 2 articles are really useful. The author is also exploring how to apply software engineering methods to Data Science projects:

- [Structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project - part I](https://towardsdatascience.com/structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-2fa30d661c1e)
- [Structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-part-2](https://towardsdatascience.com/structure-and-automated-workflow-for-a-machine-learning-project-part-2-b5b420625102)

From the same author of the above two articles, we have the following interesting article too:

- [Building-package-for-machine-learning-project-in-python](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-package-for-machine-learning-project-in-python-3fc16f541693)

## Approaches to deal with data and version control - Data Versioning

Using Git for manage your code is a must. But also, you should able to track your data. There are different new approaches to this specific issue in Data Science projects.

- [Structuring-ml-projects-so-they-can-grow](https://towardsdatascience.com/structuring-ml-projects-so-they-can-grow-b63e89c8be8f)

The above article uses a Python package named [**lazydata**](http://github.com/rstojnic/lazydata) that is built specifically to manage data for growing ML projects.

In the following articles, the author mentions another interesting tool to manage files with git: [**git-annex**](http://git-annex.branchable.com/). 

- [How-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-version-control-your-machine-learning-task-cad74dce44c4)

The above articles is mainly devoted to the most rich tool so far
